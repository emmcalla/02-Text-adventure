# Game-Engine
The interactive-fiction game engine we designed in class.

This is the simplest form of this that I can imagine, but hopefully it is useful to you. If you choose to use this, your responsibility will be to fill out game.json with enough locations to meet the project requirements. Since this is licensed with the MIT License, you can certainly do whatever you would like with this as a starting place.

This game engine is used to create a simple text adventure game by Emma Callahan. The game is a project for C220 at IU.

You play as a reporter who has the chance to speak to an important government offical who has confessed to a crime and has been detained. He refuses to speak to any detectives or any police, instead only confiding in the media, in you, to tell his story.

This game was origionally meant to be much longer and have more "meat" to the narrative bones, but constraint on time had that cut short.
