		You sit in sterile, gray interogation room that you have been taken to by the city police. The senator sits in front of you. He's not handcuffed. He's wearing a crisp, clean orange jumpsuit and he smiles once you enter.
		You settle into the chair across from him and the police have left the room. The senator would only speak to you on the condition that there be no cameras or recording devices. The camera in the corner of the room isn't lit up and looks downward.
		Your boss has provided you with a list of topics to ask about in order to make the story, but he encouraged you to get the truth out of him.
		List:
		name, crime, jail, past life, sentence, guards, inmates, hobbies
